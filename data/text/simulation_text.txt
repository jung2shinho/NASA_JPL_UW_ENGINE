## Methodology

**Step 1**: Data Preprocessing is aligned with the time scale. Loaded the raw GIC data (NERC) and resampled data to align time scales.

**Step 2**: Perform the wavelet transform (Discrete/Stationary Wavelet Transform) Extract coefficients for each GIC monitor (per event),visualized via heat map.

**Step 3**: Find correlation between wavelet coefficients of each station. Utilized sliding window method for finding correlation.
